# Begin attempting to add to watercourse line layer
Following Shawns advice, I clipped a small portion of the watercourse layer (over 2 million records) and tried to snap the point data stations that have the water quality information to it.
However a lot of the stations have little to no data included into it, so unfortunately the attempt to color code water quality on the watercourse line data will not work (need better data).

# Begin adding to the built website showcasing Web 6 solution
Begin building upon the webpage the Yingjia created and hosted on her github, will start by linking the websites code to my IDE (Git clone).

After the repository was cloned, I began updating some html for a better presentation of our web solutions (changing headers, adding details to the four pages of html).
I also updated the template and added the web map whose current solution is part of our problem statement. I uploaded that photo onto index.html.

I created more content on the website adding new CSS for the images that I imported into the repository. The new CSS included:

.center {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 30%;
  border: black;
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 2px;
}

.center1 {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
  width: 40%;
  border: black;
  border-style: solid;
  border-width: 2px;
}
